5. In the **Name** text box, enter the name of your game or app.

   If you want your product to include a reduced, demo version of your game, select the **Create a game demo** check box so that a checkmark appears.

   If you know your Product Group, click the **Product Group** drop-down list and then click your Product Group.

6. Click the **Reserve product name** button. A "Setup" page appears, and initially the top of the page reads "Status: Incomplete":

## 2. Contact your Microsoft Representative to Xbox Live-enable the app or game

1. In Partner Center, select your app or game.  

   The "Application overview" or "Game overview" page appears.

2. Click **App setup** or **Game setup**.  The "App setup" page or "Game setup" page appears.

3. Toward the bottom of the page, click the **Identity details** link. The "Identity details" section expands:

   ![The "Identity details" section](live-setup-partner-center-partners-images/identity-details-section.png)

4. Copy the **Store ID**.

5. Contact your Microsoft representative to ask them to add Xbox Live capability to your title.
   Include the store ID.
   For example:

   * **Subject**: Need to enable game for Xbox Live

   * **Body**: "Hi support, I would like to enable my Partner Center product.  The store ID is [your game's store ID]."

Your Microsoft representative emails you telling you that your app or game has been enabled in Partner Center.

The initial setup of your app or game is now complete.
Your game cannot be tested yet; you need to publish the game first.
To do this, you take the identity information that was generated above, and push that information into the Xbox Live runtime system, as follows.

## 3. Publish the game

In Partner Center, with your game selected as in the above procedures, do the following.

1. In the top right, click the **Publish** link.

   The "Publish gameplay settings" dialog box appears.

   ![The "Publish gameplay settings" dialog box](live-setup-partner-center-partners-images/pc_pubgameplaysetgs_dbx.png)

2. Click the **Confirm** button.

   At the bottom of the dialog box, the message appears: "Publishing configuration..." and then "Publishing configuration finished successfully."

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Though the UI says "finished successfully", the Xbox Live servers can take as long as 30 minutes to replicate the new info.

3. Click the **Close** button.

   The "Publish gameplay settings" dialog box closes, and the "Gameplay Setting" page remains displayed.

The SDK can now be used in an application to sign-in.
