# Creating an app and publishing it for testing, for Managed Partners


## Introduction

Before writing any code, you must set up a new title on your service configuration portal.
You can learn more about service configuration in [Xbox Live service configuration IDs, for Managed Partners](../../../test-release/portal-config/live-service-config-ids-mp.md).

This article through this process with the following assumptions:
* You are developing a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) title.  UWP titles run on Xbox One (or later) consoles, Windows 10 desktop PCs, and mobile devices.
* You are configuring your title in Partner Center.
* You are using either Visual Studio with a custom game engine, or Unity.
* Your development machine is running Windows 10.

Provided that the above are true, the remainder of this article will walk through everything required to get a title configured in Partner Center, a new project created, and Xbox Live sign-in code written and tested.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are part of the Xbox Live Creators Program, the above assumptions apply to you and you should follow along with this article.


## Partner Center Setup

You need an Xbox Live enabled title created in Partner Center as a pre-requisite to any Xbox Live functionality working.


### Create a Microsoft account

If you don't have a Microsoft Account (also known as an MSA), you will need to first create one at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=254486](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=254486).
If you have an Office 365 account, use Outlook.com, or have an Xbox Live account - you probably already have an MSA.


### Register as an App Developer

Before you can create a new title in Partner Center, you will need to register as an App Developer.

To register, go to [https://developer.microsoft.com/store/register](https://developer.microsoft.com/store/register) and follow the sign-up process.


### Create a new UWP title

Next, you need a UWP title defined in Partner Center.
You do that by first going to the Partner Center Dashboard:

Then, create a new title.
You'll need to reserve a name.

You'll then be taken to the *App Overview* page for your app.
The primary page where you'll be configuring Xbox Live is under the **Services -> Xbox Live** menu shown below.

## Create an Xbox Live Account

You will need an Xbox Live Account to sign-in to Xbox Live.
If you already have such an account that you use to sign-in on your Xbox One (or later) console, or in the Xbox App on Windows 10, then you can use that account.

Otherwise you should open the Xbox App on your PC and sign in with your Microsoft Account.
The Xbox App will then be enabled for use with Xbox Live.

You can find the Xbox App by going into the *Start Menu* and typing in "Xbox" as shown below.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a new title created, you can set up an Xbox Live enabled title in your Game Engine, Visual Studio or build environment of choice.
