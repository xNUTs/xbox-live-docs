# Add and compile XSAPI source code into a UWP project

You can add and compile the Xbox Live APIs source in a UWP project.

The Xbox Live API (XSAPI) source is now available on GitHub at [https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-api](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-api).
Developers can follow these instructions to update their projects to use a local build.

You might want to build XSAPI yourself if:
* If you want to debug an issue to understand where an error code is coming from.
* If we provide a source code patch to fix an issue for you, before we can distribute a QFE.

To compile the XSAPI project yourself, follow the instructions on the GitHub project site.
