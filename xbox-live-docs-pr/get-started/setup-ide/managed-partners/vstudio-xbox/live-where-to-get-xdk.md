# Getting the XDK

The Xbox Development Kit (XDK) is not publicly available.
Managed Partners have access to the XDK and associated development resources such as documentation and middleware tools.
See [Joining a developer program](../../../join-dev-program/live-join-dev-program-nav.md).

The XDK can be downloaded from the [software downloads page](https://developer.microsoft.com/games/xbox/partner/resources-softwaredownloads) on the developer.microsoft.com site.

If you do not have access to the site, you will not be able to download or use the XDK.
If you do no not have access, contact your account manager.
