# Registering for player Stat change notifications

Real-Time Activity (RTA) is enabled for statistics via the Xbox Live Service Configuration.

If you have configured your service configuration in the Partner Center, you can register for stat change notifications under **Xbox Live > Gameplay settings > Player stats > Stat change notifications**.

Presence data and achievements data are automatically enabled for RTA.
