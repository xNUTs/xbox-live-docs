# Clubs

> [!NOTE]
> This is preliminary documentation.

The Clubs feature easily integrates your game's teams, clans, and communities.

General-purpose clubs in Xbox Live are focused on games and interests.
Clubs are created and managed by gamers to socialize and play with other like-minded gamers.


## Benefits of clubs

Gamers engage more when they find a like-minded community.
Being in a club corresponds with 40% more engagement on Xbox Live, and more friends every month.

Higher engagement means more daily logins, more time in games, and more purchases.


## Official clubs

Official Clubs are managed by the publisher, for a specific game.
Official Clubs are for community managers to engage with the gaming community, and for gamers to find other gamers.

An Official Club is a set of console, mobile, and PC experiences and web tools to help game publishers engage with their customers.

Official Clubs will replace Game Hubs.


## Social clubs

Social clubs are managed by a user, and could be for any interest, such as a genre of game or a specific game.


## In-game clubs

In-Game Clubs are defined by the developer, integrated into the game such as a clan or guild.
Players can then create and use the type of club defined by the developer.

The developer defines the size of the club and the rules for the club.


### Benefits of in-game clubs

In-game clubs can help your game in the following ways:

* Integrates groups (such as clans or squads) into your game.

* Makes your existing group more discoverable.

* Provides mobile communication tools for your groups.

* Enables your groups to work cross-platform (PC/Xbox/Mobile).
