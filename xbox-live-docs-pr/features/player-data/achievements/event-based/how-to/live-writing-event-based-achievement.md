# Writing an event to power an event-based achievement

This example code shows how to write an event.
On the service, this will update event based-stats based on the stat rules you've defined in Partner Center.
Those stats, in turn, will power event-based achievements.


**C API**
<!-- XblEventsWriteInGameEvent.md -->
```cpp
HRESULT hr = XblEventsWriteInGameEvent(
    xboxLiveContext,
    "PuzzleSolved",
    R"({"DifficultyLevelId":100, "GameplayModeId":"Adventure"})",
    R"({"LocationX":1,"LocationY":1})"
);
```
