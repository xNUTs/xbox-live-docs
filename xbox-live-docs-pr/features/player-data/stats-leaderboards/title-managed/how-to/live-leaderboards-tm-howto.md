## Introduction

As described in [Player Data overview](../../../live-playerdata-overview.md), Leaderboards are a great way to encourage competition between your players, and keep players engaged in trying to beat their previous best score as well as that of their friends.

Leaderboards for Featured Stats are always displayed in a title's Game Hub and sometimes displayed as a part of the UI for a title when it is pinned to the homepage.
You can also use your configured Featured Stats to create Leaderboards inside of your title.
For more information about Featured Stats, see the section [Configured stats and featured leaderboards](../live-stats-tm-overview.md#configured-stats-and-featured-leaderboards) in the article "Title-managed Stats overview".


## Choosing Good Leaderboards

As discussed in [Player Stats](../live-stats-tm-overview.md), a leaderboard corresponds to a stat that you have defined.
You should choose leaderboards that correspond to an accomplishment that a player can work towards improving.

For example, Best Lap Time in a racing game is a good leaderboard, because players will want to work towards improving their Best Lap Time.
Other examples are Kill/Death ratio for shooters, or Max Combo Size in a fighting game.


## When To Display Leaderboards

You have the ability to display leaderboards at any time in your title.
You should choose a time when a leaderboard will not interfere with the gameplay or the flow of your title.
In between rounds and after matches are both good times.


## How to Display Leaderboards

There are numerous options for displaying leaderboards provided in the Xbox Live SDK.
If you are using Unity with the Xbox Live Creators Program, you can get started by using a Leaderboard Prefab to display your leaderboard data.
For specifics, see [Configuring Xbox Live in Unity](../../../../../get-started/setup-ide/creators/unity-win10/live-configure-xbl-in-unity.md).

If you are coding against the Xbox Live SDK directly, then read on to learn about the APIs you can use.


## Programming Guide

There are several Leaderboard APIs you can use to get the current state of a leaderboard.
All of the APIs are asynchronous and do not block.

You would make a request to get leaderboard data and continue your usual game processing.
When the leaderboard results are returned from the service, you can display the results at the appropriate time.

You should request the leaderboard data from the service, slightly ahead of when you want to display it, so that players are not blocked waiting for the leaderboard to display.


## Title-managed Leaderboards APIs (method signatures)

Event-based Leaderboards is the preferred approach.
Title-managed Leaderboards is not recommended for new code.

To make calls to the title-managed Leaderboard service, you will use the `StatisticManager` leaderboard APIs, instead of the `LeaderboardService` leaderboard APIs.

## Getting a title-managed Leaderboard (C API)


<a id="gael"></a>

### Getting an entire leaderboard

Use `XblLeaderboardGetLeaderboardAsync` to return the leaderboard values for the given leaderboard, starting from the top of the leaderboard.


**C API**
<!-- XblLeaderboardGetLeaderboardAsync.md -->
```cpp
auto asyncBlock = std::make_unique<XAsyncBlock>();
asyncBlock->queue = queue;
asyncBlock->context = nullptr;
asyncBlock->callback = [](XAsyncBlock* asyncBlock)
{
    std::unique_ptr<XAsyncBlock> asyncBlockPtr{ asyncBlock }; // Take over ownership of the XAsyncBlock*
    size_t resultSize;
    HRESULT hr = XblLeaderboardGetLeaderboardResultSize(asyncBlock, &resultSize);

    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        leaderboardBuffer.resize(resultSize);
        XblLeaderboardResult* leaderboard{};

        hr = XblLeaderboardGetLeaderboardResult(asyncBlock, resultSize, leaderboardBuffer.data(), &leaderboard, nullptr);

        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
            // Use XblLeaderboardResult in result
            for (auto row = 0u; row < leaderboard->rowsCount; ++row)
            {
                std::stringstream rowText;
                rowText << leaderboard->rows[row].xboxUserId << "\t";

                for (auto column = 0u; column < leaderboard->rows[row].columnValuesCount; ++column)
                {
                    rowText << leaderboard->rows[row].columnValues[column] << "\t";
                }
            }
        }
    }
};

XblLeaderboardQuery leaderboardQuery = {}; 
pal::strcpy(leaderboardQuery.scid, sizeof(leaderboardQuery.scid), scid.c_str()) 
leaderboardQuery.leaderboardName = leaderboardName.c_str(); 
// See below on more options in XblLeaderboardQuery

HRESULT hr = XblLeaderboardGetLeaderboardAsync(
    xboxLiveContext,
    leaderboardQuery,
    asyncBlock.get());
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    // The call succeeded, so release the std::unique_ptr ownership of XAsyncBlock* since the callback will take over ownership.
    // If the call fails, the std::unique_ptr will keep ownership and delete the XAsyncBlock*
    asyncBlock.release();
}
```

### Getting a leaderboard around a specified rank

Use the same code as above, except that to create the `XblLeaderboardQuery`, use this code instead:


**C API**
<!-- XblLeaderboardGetLeaderboardAsync-Rank.md -->
```cpp
XblLeaderboardQuery leaderboardQuery = {};
pal::strcpy(leaderboardQuery.scid, sizeof(leaderboardQuery.scid), scid.c_str());
leaderboardQuery.leaderboardName = leaderboardName.c_str();
leaderboardQuery.skipResultToRank = 100;
leaderboardQuery.maxItems = 100;
```

<!-- **Reference**
* [XblLeaderboardQuery](xblleaderboardquery.md) -->


<a id="galaasp"></a>

### Getting a leaderboard around a specified player

Use the same code as above, except that to create the `XblLeaderboardQuery`, use this code instead:


**C API**
<!-- XblLeaderboardGetLeaderboardAsync-User.md -->
```cpp
XblLeaderboardQuery leaderboardQuery = {};
pal::strcpy(leaderboardQuery.scid, sizeof(leaderboardQuery.scid), scid.c_str());
leaderboardQuery.leaderboardName = leaderboardName.c_str();
leaderboardQuery.skipToXboxUserId = xboxUserId;
leaderboardQuery.maxItems = 100;
```

<!-- **Reference**
* [XblLeaderboardQuery](xblleaderboardquery.md) -->


## Getting a title-managed Leaderboard (C++ API)


### 1. Get a Singleton Instance of the stats_manager

Before you can call the `stats_manager` functions you will need to set a variable to its Singleton instance.

```cpp
m_statsManager = stats_manager::get_singleton_instance();
```


### 2. Create a LeaderboardQuery

The `leaderboard_query` will dictate the amount, order, and starting point of the data returned from the leaderboard call.

A `leaderboard_query` has a few attributes that can be set which will effect the data returned:

|Property |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|m_skipResultToRank     |this uint variable will determine what ranking the leaderboard data will start with when returning. Rankings start at rank 1.         |
|m_skipResultToMe     |if set to true this boolean value will cause the leaderboard data returned to start at the `XboxLiveUser` used in the `get_leaderboard()` call.  |
|m_order     |Enums of type `xbox::services::leaderboard::sort_order` have two possible values, ascending, and descending. Setting this variable for your query will determine the sort order of your leaderboard.        |
|m_maxItems     |This uint determines the maximum number of rows to return per call to `get_leaderboard` or `get_social_leaderboard()`.         |

`leaderboard_query` has several "set_" functions you can use to assign values to these properties.
The following code shows how to set up a `leaderboard_query`:

```cpp
leaderboard::leaderboard_query leaderboardQuery;
leaderboardQuery.set_skip_result_to_rank(10);
leaderboardQuery.set_max_items(10);
leaderboardQuery.set_order(sort_order::descending);
```

This query would return ten rows of the leaderboard, starting at the 100th-ranked individual.

> [!WARNING]
> Setting SkipResultToRank higher than the number of players contained within the leaderboard will cause the leaderboard data to return with zero rows.


### 3. Call get_leaderboard

```cpp
leaderboard::leaderboard_query leaderboardQuery;
m_statsManager->get_leaderboard(user, statName, leaderboardQuery);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `statName` used in the `GetLeaderboard()` call must be the same as the name of a stat configured for your title in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard), which is case-sensitive.


### 4. Read the Leaderboard data

To read the leaderboard data, call the `stats_manager::do_work()` function, which returns a list of `stat_event` values.
Leaderboard data will be contained in a `stat_event` of the type `stat_event_type::get_leaderboard_complete`.
When you come across an event of this type in the list of `stat_event`s, you can look through the `leaderboard_result` contained in the `stat_event` to access the data.

Sample `do_work()` handler:

```cpp
void Sample::UpdateStatsManager()
{
    // Process events from the stats manager
    // This should be called each frame update

    auto statsEvents = m_statsManager->do_work();
    std::wstring text;

    for (const auto& evt : statsEvents)
    {
        switch (evt.event_type())
        {
            case stat_event_type::local_user_added: 
                text = L"local_user_added"; 
                break;

            case stat_event_type::local_user_removed: 
                text = L"local_user_removed"; 
                break;

            case stat_event_type::stat_update_complete: 
                text = L"stat_update_complete"; 
                break;

            case stat_event_type::get_leaderboard_complete: //leaderboard data is read here
                text = L"get_leaderboard_complete";
                auto getLeaderboardCompleteArgs = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<leaderboard_result_event_args>(evt.event_args());
                ProcessLeaderboards(evt.local_user(), getLeaderboardCompleteArgs->result());
                break;
        }

        stringstream_t source;
        source << _T("StatsManager event: ");
        source << text;
        source << _T(".");
        m_console->WriteLine(source.str().c_str());
    }
}
```

#### Reading the Leaderboard data from the Leaderboard Result  

```cpp
void Sample::PrintLeaderboard(const xbox::services::leaderboard::leaderboard_result& leaderboard)
{
    if (leaderboard.rows().size() > 0)
    {
        m_console->Format(L"%16s %6s %12s %12s\n", L"Gamertag", L"Rank", L"Percentile", L"Values");
    }

    for (const xbox::services::leaderboard::leaderboard_row& row : leaderboard.rows())
    {
        string_t colValues;
        for (auto columnValue : row.column_values())
        {
            colValues = colValues + L" ";
            colValues = colValues + columnValue;
        }
        m_console->Format(L"%16s %6d %12f %12s\n", row.gamertag().c_str(), row.rank(), row.percentile(), colValues.c_str());
    }
}
```  

#### Retrieving further pages of data from the leaderboard

```cpp
void Sample::ProcessLeaderboards(
    _In_ std::shared_ptr<xbox::services::system::xbox_live_user> user,
    _In_ xbox::services::xbox_live_result<xbox::services::leaderboard::leaderboard_result> result
    )
{
    if (!result.err())
    {
        auto leaderboardResult = result.payload();
        PrintLeaderboard(leaderboardResult);

        // Keep processing if there is more data in the leaderboard
        if (leaderboardResult.has_next())
        {
            if (!leaderboardResult.get_next_query().err())
            {               
                auto lbQuery = leaderboardResult.get_next_query().payload();
                if (lbQuery.social_group().empty())
                {
                    m_statsManager->get_leaderboard(user, lbQuery.stat_name(), lbQuery);
                }
                else
                {
                    m_statsManager->get_social_leaderboard(user, lbQuery.stat_name(), lbQuery.social_group(), lbQuery);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```  


## Getting a title-managed Leaderboard (WinRT C# API)


### 1. Get a singleton instance of the StatisticManager

Before you can call the `StatisticManager` functions, you need to set a variable to its Singleton instance:

```csharp
statManager = StatisticManager.SingletonInstance;
```


### 2. Create a LeaderboardQuery

The `LeaderboardQuery` dictates the amount, order, and starting point of the data returned from the leaderboard call.

```csharp
public sealed class LeaderboardQuery : __ILeaderboardQueryPublicNonVirtuals
    {
        [Overload("CreateInstance1")]
        public LeaderboardQuery();

        public bool HasNext { get; }
        public string SocialGroup { get; }
        public string StatName { get; }
        public SortOrder Order { get; set; }
        public uint MaxItems { get; set; }
        public uint SkipResultToRank { get; set; }
        public bool SkipResultToMe { get; set; }
    }
```

A `LeaderboardQuery` has a few attributes that can be set which will effect the data returned:

|Property |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|SkipResultToRank     |this uint variable will determine what ranking the leaderboard data will start with when returning. Rankings start at rank 1.         |
|SkipResultToMe     |if set to true this boolean value will cause the leaderboard data returned to start at the `XboxLiveUser` used in the `GetLeaderboard()` call.  |
|Order     |Enums of type `Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard.SortOrder` have two possible values, ascending, and descending. Setting this variable for your query will determine the sort order of your leaderboard.        |
|MaxItems     |This uint determines the maximum number of rows to return per call to `GetLeaderboard()` or `GetSocialLeaderboard()`.         |

Forming your `LeaderboardQuery` may look like the following:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xbox.Services.Leaderboard;

LeaderboardQuery query = new LeaderboardQuery
        {
            SkipResultToRank = 100,
            MaxItems = 5
        };
```

This query would return five rows of the leaderboard starting at the 100th ranked individual.

> [!WARNING]
> Setting SkipResultToRank higher than the number of players contained within the leaderboard will cause the leaderboard data to return with zero rows.


### 3. Call GetLeaderboard()

You can now call `GetLeaderboard()` with your `XboxLiveUser`, the name of your statistic, and a `LeaderboardQuery`.

```csharp
statManager.GetLeaderboard(xboxLiveUser, statName, leaderboardQuery);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `statName` used in the `GetLeaderboard()` call must be the same as the name of a stat configured for your title in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard), which is case-sensitive.


### 4. Read Leaderboard data

In order to read the leaderboard data, you will need to call the `StatisticManager.DoWork()` function, which returns a list of `StatisticEvent` values.

Leaderboard data will be contained in a `StatisticEvent` of the type `GetLeaderboardComplete`.
When you come across an event of this type in the list of `StatisticEvent`s, you can look through the `LeaderboardResult` contained in the `StatisticEvent` to access the data.

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<StatisticEvent> statEvents = statManager.DoWork(); //In practice this should be called every update frame

foreach(StatisticEvent statEvent in statEvents)
{
    if(statEvent.EventType == StatisticEventType.GetLeaderboardComplete
        && statEvent.ErrorCode == 0)
    {
        LeaderboardResultEventArgs leaderArgs = (LeaderboardResultEventArgs)statEvent.EventArgs;
        LeaderboardResult leaderboardResult = leaderArgs.Result;
        foreach(LeaderboardRow leaderRow in leaderboardResult.Rows)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine(string.Format("Rank: {0} | Gamertag: {1} | {2}:{3}\n\n", leaderRow.Rank, leaderRow.Gamertag, "test", leaderRow.Values[0]));
        }
    }
}
```

In your title code, `StatisticManager.DoWork()` should be used to handle all incoming Statistic Manager events, and not just for leaderboards.

> [!NOTE]
> To retrieve the `LeaderboardResultEventArgs`, cast the `StatisticEvent.EventArgs` as a `LeaderboardResultEventArgs` variable.


### 5. Retrieve more leaderboard data

To retrieve later pages of leaderboard data, use the `LeaderboardResult.HasNext` property and the `LeaderboardResult.GetNextQuery()` function to retrieve the `LeaderboardQuery`, which will bring you the next page of data:

```csharp
while (leaderboardResult.HasNext)
{
    leaderboardQuery = leaderboardResult.GetNextQuery();
    statManager.GetLeaderboard(xboxLiveUser, leaderboardQuery.StatName, leaderboardQuery)
    // StatisticManager.DoWork() is called
    // Leaderboard results are read
}
```
