# XR-067: Maintaining Multiplayer Session State &diams;

On Xbox consoles, titles with online multiplayer functionality must maintain session-state information in the Xbox Multiplayer Session Directory (MPSD).

On devices other than Xbox consoles, titles which offer cross-platform multiplayer functionality with Xbox consoles must maintain session-state information in the Xbox Multiplayer Session Directory (MPSD).

## More Information
When multiple users are playing together in a networked experience, that grouping of players must have at least one session in the MPSD containing all the players. When a session is in interactive multiplayer gameplay, the gameplay capability in the multiplayer session must be set to True.  As players join and leave the experience, they must be added to and removed from the MPSD session, respectively.

Intent: Ensure that the Xbox system is aware of the users who are playing together online. This information is used to support the recent players list, player feedback, usage reporting, and other platform features.
