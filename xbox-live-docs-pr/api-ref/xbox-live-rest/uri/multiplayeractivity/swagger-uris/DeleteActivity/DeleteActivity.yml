      This is a string representation of a monotonically increasing number

      (ulong) that the client must pass in for each request. It is used to

      guarantee the ordering of the updates to an activity. A good example

      of a sequenceNumber can be the unix time of the client since it's

      guaranteed to be increasing. Must be greater than 0, and cannot be

      greater than the maximum ulong.
