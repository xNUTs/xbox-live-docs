# Config as Source tools (XblConfig.exe)

[Config as Source](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-developer-tools/blob/master/CONFIGASSOURCE.md) is a suite of tools that Microsoft developed to accommodate advanced users, by providing officially supported tools and APIs for integrating into our configuration services.
These Xbox Live services are normally configured for your title in Partner Center, including services ranging from leaderboards to achievements, to web services and relying parties.

For many game developers, using Partner Center is sufficient.
For advanced users, however, there is a desire to integrate common configuration tasks into their own processes and tools.
Config as Source is intended to support these scenarios by providing command line tools and new APIs to support custom integration into your existing workflows and pipelines.

This command-line tool suite is part of `XboxLiveTools.zip`; see [Development tools for Xbox Live](live-tools.md).

Config as Source (`XblConfig.exe`) is used to manage Xbox Live configuration data for games developed in Windows Dev Center.
