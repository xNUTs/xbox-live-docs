# Testing and Releasing

You can publish a game to a private sandbox for testing, or to the public on the Xbox Managed Partners Store.

To publish a game for testing or public release, first complete the <a href="../get-started/live-getstarted-nav.md">Getting Started</a> steps so that your game can do basic sign-in to Xbox Live.
